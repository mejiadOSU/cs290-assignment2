  This is photo of my family on a trip to Memphis Tennessee. That was a trip to a friends wedding. 
  It was the first traditional indian wedding Ive ever been to. The cerremony was long and the party was short
  but, this wedding did stretch over three days. This trip encouraged me to travel more around the US.

  Traveling with a child is no easy task. I would like to travel more but its not as easy with my little two year old.
  We have to plan out all the meals prior to because of my childs picky eating habbits. We also dont allow her to sleep in our
  bed which makes a hotel stay a tricky task. The time difference does not help either. Its difficult to get my little
  one to adjust. Although its tough I this doesnt stop us and we continue to try and travel atleast once a year.
